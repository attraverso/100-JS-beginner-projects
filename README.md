### Project description:

Complete all challenges as listed in [this post](https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/) from [jsbeginners.com](https://jsbeginners.com).
I tried to use the given materials as little as possible and instead I recreated all the necessary HTML/CSS files from scratch.

### Notes:

Project 2 is in folder 001 as it was based on the same files.
